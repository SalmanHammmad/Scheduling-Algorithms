## Introduction

Efficient patient scheduling is crucial in healthcare management. This system implements several scheduling algorithms, allowing healthcare providers to choose the most appropriate one based on their needs. It provides both a CLI and GUI for interaction.

## Features

- Support for multiple scheduling algorithms.
- Gantt chart visualization for each scheduling result.
- JSON-based input and output for patient data.
- Both CLI and GUI interfaces for user interaction.

## Scheduling Algorithms

- **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
  - Preemptive and Non-Preemptive
- **Priority Scheduling**
  - Preemptive and Non-Preemptive
- **Multi-Level Queue (MLQ)**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SalmanHammmad/Scheduling-Algorithms.git
